### Structured Journalism
I found a lot of content from 2015 about something called Structured Journalism. The idea that journalism itself can be broken down into data points which can then be used to create more stories down the road, or provide interesting links between stories. One Medium post went so far as to call this [The Next Revolution in Storytelling](https://medium.com/interactive-journalism/structured-journalism-the-next-revolution-in-storytelling-91557c48c121). It looks like both [The New York Times](http://nytlabs.com/projects/editor.html) and [BBC](http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/2015/07/07/a-manifesto-for-structured-journalism/) were working on ways to use machine learning to turn journalism stories into this kind of structured data for one reason for another. It was also the inspiration for Circa (before it was bought out and gutted by Sinclair). It seems like a big thing that quickly died soon after it was born.

I know The LA Times Data Desk still uses this philosophy on some of it's projects. One (which I worked) on is called [The Homicide Report](http://homicide.latimes.com/), and I know it's used for their [recipes site](http://recipes.latimes.com/). These data sets are created manually though, and turned into data. They seem to have stopped using machine learning as the classifier for it.
