# Machine Learning (Woo!)

### Tutorials
This set of tutorials on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) were quick and easy thanks in no small part to Google's tremendous production budget. I highly recommend going through this series if you want to breeze through it quickly (no pun intended).
1. [Hello World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal): A basic introduction into how machine learning works to classify things.
2. [Decision Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNa99PG8hR8&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&index=2): A deeper look into how the machine makes these decisions using features.
3. [Feature Selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9fDIAflCMY&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&index=3): A theoretical dive into what exactly makes a good feature (the property you're going to use to measure the differences between your types).
4. [Pipelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNa99PG8hR8&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&index=4): There's a number of things your app will need to do every time it's run to process the data, analyze it, and classify new data. This video shows you how to build that pipeline.
5. [Classifiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNa99PG8hR8&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&index=5): An introduction into making an actual classifier.
6. [Image Classifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNa99PG8hR8&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&index=6): An example of a classifier used to recognize the content of an image.
7. [OCR Classifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNa99PG8hR8&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&index=7): An example of a classifier used to recognzie a digit that was handwritten.
8. [Decision Tree Classifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNa99PG8hR8&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&index=8): A deep dive into how to get more granular with editing your decision tree.
9. [Feature Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNa99PG8hR8&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&index=9): Sometimes features aren't a clear data point, but instead a combination of those data points. For example, maybe height and weight independantly won't tell you about someone's likelihood to get heart disease, but a calculted BMI might be a feature worth analyzing. This process is called feature engineering, and this video introduces that concept.

### Structured Journalism
I found a lot of content from 2015 about something called Structured Journalism. The idea that journalism itself can be broken down into data points which can then be used to create more stories down the road, or provide interesting links between stories. One Medium post went so far as to call this [The Next Revolution in Storytelling](https://medium.com/interactive-journalism/structured-journalism-the-next-revolution-in-storytelling-91557c48c121). It looks like both [The New York Times](http://nytlabs.com/projects/editor.html) and [BBC](http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/2015/07/07/a-manifesto-for-structured-journalism/) were working on ways to use machine learning to turn journalism stories into this kind of structured data for one reason for another. It was also the inspiration for Circa (before it was bought out and gutted by Sinclair). It seems like a big thing that quickly died soon after it was born.

I know The LA Times Data Desk still uses this philosophy on some of it's projects. One (which I worked) on is called [The Homicide Report](http://homicide.latimes.com/), and I know it's used for their [recipes site](http://recipes.latimes.com/). These data sets are created manually though, and turned into data. They seem to have stopped using machine learning as the classifier for it.

### Ethics in Machine Learning
As I normally do with these research things, here's my quick blurb about ethics. We should consider them. Machines aren't objective, algorithms aren't objective, machine learning algorithms aren't objective. All technology has embedded in it the biases of it's creators. But [don't take my word for it](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/03/how-digital-leaders-from-the-bbc-and-al-jazeera-are-planning-for-the-ethics-of-ai/). I'll get off my pulpit now.

### Tutorials
Adding on to Andrew's videos, [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-python) has a good walkthrough on machine learning. If you go to the comments, the creators have answered questions people have had so that might be useful.
### Machine Learning in Journalism
So some of this will be over our heads but these are some examples of machine learning in news stories.
1. ProPublica has used machine learning to analyze Congressional representatives' priorities by reading keywords in press releases for [Represent](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/teaching-a-machine-what-congress-cares-about).
2. ProPublica also used machine learning to find out that the Broward County Sheriff's Office was using a biased system to predict whether black and white felons would reoffend for its project [Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing). If you're feeling really brave, their code is [here](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis). 
3. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution used machine learning for [Doctors and Sex Abuse](http://doctors.ajc.com/about_this_investigation/) to analyze documents based on keywords to flag those that need to be read. 
4. Machine learning can also be used for [analytics](https://blog.google/topics/journalism-news/how-publishers-can-take-advantage-machine-learning/) and understanding one's audience or moderating content.
